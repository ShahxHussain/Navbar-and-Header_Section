# Landing-Page-Header-Section
This repository contains the code for a simple website's navbar (menu) and header section, which was my first project completed on Upwork for a foreign client. The project focuses on creating an interactive and visually appealing navigation bar and header section for a website.
    
<h3>Introduction<h3/>
<p>The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in web development, specifically in designing and implementing the navbar and header section of a website. The code in this repository provides a basic structure and styling for the navbar and header, which can be customized and integrated into a larger website.<p/>
